  description: "The project aspires to demonstrate that an 'ethnological perspective' can make a valuable contribution to the study of entrepreneurship. In its academic component, the project will employ a mixed methods-approach to collect comparative evidence and engage in emically inspired theory-building on entrepreneurial ecosystems in the IT and Green Economy industries of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. In its applied research component, the project will integrate closely with practitioners of the public and private sectors to create socioeconomic impact beyond academia, such as in the field of policy advice.",
